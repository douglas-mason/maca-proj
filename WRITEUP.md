# The Starship Directory...

This project uses the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev/)

The idea of this application is that you can browse the pages of starships in the list and 
favorite ships by clicking the heart icon on the card.  Those favorited items will show up on the 
"Favorites" page in which you can also type notes for each item.  Clicking the hearts on the "Favorites" 
page will remove them from the list.

The starship cards utilize a basic generic card component that could be used for other purposes and is a starting point to build a more feature rich UI library.

Also, there is a menu system that is utilized in the header of the app.  The menu allows you to define 
items that would show inline as well as items that should render in an overflow dropdown menu triggered by 
clicking the ellipsis.  Also, there is a responsive menu item component that allows you to define primary 
and secondary content to be shown based on screen size.  You can experience this by resizing the window
from a typical desktop size to 
a mobile size.
